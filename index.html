  <p>
      My Concept ideas is about space as an musical instrument, where celestial object can be use as an
        intrument tool by clicking and moving it around. My aim for this project is to people to use space as a other way to understand about music.

        <p>TECHNICAL APPROACH</p>
        <p>The UI is build on a HTML, CSS, Javascript. The Planet orbit is running on a Math.random() when you hold and drag the planet, it will generate random pitch and rhymth that can be click on while using
         it. i'm also aiming my layout like a control panel, there will be a bar that you can turn on and off volume,
        changing pitch when interact, while moving the mouse there is also an cornate indicator moving around.</p>
     <ul>
        <li>The input: When interacting with the planet such as click or drag</li>
        <li>System: Javascript calculates random tone and generate them</li>
        <li>Output: Audio play as a response depend on the interaction</li>

        <p>TECHNICAL ISSUES AND ENCOUNTER</p>
    <p>
        The prototype itself starting with a sun in the middle and 3 planet as an experiment: Mercury, Venus, Earth.
         The prototype responsed to the interaction. However there are technical problems for example the interaction between: 
         <li>
        +The first problems:
        <li>
        I encounter with the UI is the box is overlayed on each other, that mean it only interact with one planet instead of other 2. After i founded out the 
        Z-index, it help me to stacking the positioned HTML element in Depth. Using it to help me  control the position of the planet, i managed to make all planet interaction a
        vailible for the user.
        </li>
        <li></li>
         <li>
        +The second problems:
        <li>
        My test on this is by dragging Mercury, When i start dragging my planet, it generated random sound, with Math.random(), however after i released the planet, it doesn't return to the orbit, realizing the issues relate to the 
         i added these 3 line in the Javascript telling it to return the reset the position of Mercury,
        <ul>
        <li>mercury.style.left = "";</li>
        <li> mercury.style.top = "";</li>
        <li>  mercury.style.transform = "";</li>
        </ul> 
        <li> This will inline the code for the css to clear the position and transform, reseting the planet back to it original CSS.</li>
       <li> </li>
       <li>
        +The third problems:
       </li>
       <li>However there is a glitch in the sound system, when you are interacting with the planet Mercury by dragging it. I founded out that it have extend the sound when you click on it
        or playing the same sound when you interact with other planet. I'm currently trying to figure out the issues but can't seem to find the problems and don't understand how to fix it.

   <p>PEER USER FEEDBACK</p>
   <p>
     After reading the Feedback, the most common error in the system is the lack of information that need to be representing, what i also realizing about the interface is
    the instruction does not make the experience clear enough. I am aiming for the self exploration, when user explore the interaction themself and understanding the meaning of 
    each feature. However, despite of the goal i want, the lack of feature show in the websites make the experience not only hard to understand but also difficult to navigate.
    Some feedback also giving a strong opions on the other part of the prototype, such as giving a different sound to interact, or different element to make the interaction
    more meaningfull. Overall, the confusion of the experience can be the problem of why people have a difficult time to interact with it, and the lack of information that 
    i want to bring for the app it not meet the expectaion.

    <p>Reflection and Conclusion</p>
    <p>
      From the feedback i recieved, the most critics i recieved the most is mostly about how the prototype need a clearer instruction. Another strong critics is about how i need to 
      give the theme more stronger so it more appealing and creating more interactive that feel more dynamic and rewarding. These feedback make me realized that i need to make make the balance
      between the ability to understand and more diverse in my design that it can really help my
      experience feeling more alive. Moving forward, i'll add a message or a short guiding arrow, and ensure the audio is more directly linked to the users actions.
